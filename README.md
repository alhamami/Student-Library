# Student-Library

## Project Description:
- The idea of the program is to provide all the resources that the 
university student needs during his academic stage.

## The category of beneficiaries of the project:
- Currently, the project is targeting students of the College of 
Computer and Information Sciences at King Saud University.

## The future vision of the project:
- The next goal of the project is to include all other colleges with 
various academic majors so that the benefit is pervading all 
students.

## Project features:
- Collecting educational resources and experiences of former 
students in one center.
- The project's ability to develop and update automatically 
and easily in the event that any update is issued, the student will 
appear in a window notifying him of new updates being issued, 
and all he has to do is agree to the update only.
- The absorption of the project for King Saud University students 
only in order to ensure the quality of the benefit provided to the 
students, as each student must register his university number 
and any password of his choice, then after that, the program 
automatically withdraws the Mac Address of student's device 
and connects it to his account to ensure that the registered 
account is not shared with any other party that is not included 
The domain of King Saud University students, where he will be 
refused entry to the program because his Mac Address is not 
compatible with the data recorded in the program, even if the 
user name and password are correct.

## How complete the project is?

### The project is still under development, and in the future it is 
expected that the project will be able to:
- Linking the registration automatically to a database, 
since currently, after completing the registration 
process, a document appears for the student on the 
desktop that contains all his information addition to the 
Mac Address of student's device and all that because 
the project is still under development.
